# journal
Store your thoughts about code - in the code!

# Introduction
**journal** is a simple tool to track your thoughts as you code. It allows you to write memos to yourself (and potentially other team members) to explain the concepts that go into your code better. Or maybe its just notes that dont fit anywhere else or maybe they're high level todos. You decide!

#Why journal
TBD reference to literature research.

# Install

Currently, journal is an Atom Plugin. Once its published to the Atom package site, you should be able to pull it down from inside atom itself.

# Usage

Once installed, you'll get two menu options: "Open Journal" and "Add Entry". The first one will open up a new `journal.md` file if one doesnt exist, and the second one will create a new line with the current timestamp - all ready for you to make journal entries. Dont forget to check the journal file in when you commit the code!
